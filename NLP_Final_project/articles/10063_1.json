It is used primarily for controlling adult mosquitoes but", "is also used on food and feed crops and in greenhouses. For mosquito", "control, naled is most commonly applied aerially as an ultra-low volume", "(ULV) spray.

This", "periodic review of pesticide registrations, or registration review, is", "required by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act,", "amended by the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 and the Pesticide", "Registration Improvement Act.

Although EPA does not anticipate that bees will have", "significant exposure to naled due to the timing of most spray operations,", "beekeepers can further reduce potential exposure by covering colonies when", "spraying takes place, or if possible, relocating colonies to a site that", "will not be sprayed.
