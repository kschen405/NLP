Additional concerns about LAV applications include the", "potential to cause disease in immuno-compromised individuals and the", "possibility of reversion to a virulent form due to the back-mutation, the", "acquisition of compensatory mutations, or recombination with circulating", "transmissible wild-type strains (4, 5).

These mRNA vaccines are based on an engineered viral genome", "containing the genes encoding the RNA replication machinery whereas the", "structural protein sequences are replaced with the gene of interest (GoI)", "and the resulting genomes are referred as replicons. These vaccines are", "named self-amplifying mRNA and are capable of directing their", "self-replication, through synthesis of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase", "complex, generating multiple copies of the antigen-encoding mRNA, and", "express high levels of the heterologous gene when they are introduced into", "the cytoplasm of host cells, in a way that mimics production of antigens", "in vivo by viral pathogens, triggering both humoral and cellular immune", "responses (22\u201327). Self-amplifying mRNA can be derived from the engineered", "genomes of Sindbis virus, Semliki Forest virus, Kunjin virus, among others", "(28\u201330). Self-amplifying mRNAs (~9\u201311 kb) are generated from the DNA", "template with similar procedures to those previously described for", "conventional mRNAs and RNA molecules can be produced at a large scale in", "vitro.

Contamination with dsRNAs,", "derived from aberrant RNA polymerase activities, leads to the inhibition", "of translation and degradation of cellular mRNA and ribosomal RNA, thus", "decreasing protein expression by interrupting the translation machine. The", "removal of dsRNA can increase translation dramatically (35). Excess", "components and short or double strand RNAs (dsRNA) can be removed by", "purification. Initially, lithium chloride (LiCl) was used for this", "purpose, but it restricted the industrialization of mRNA vaccines and it", "did not remove dsRNAs. Purification via fast protein liquid chromatography", "(FPLC) or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) could be utilized", "to remove any remaining product and produce mRNA at a large scale and for", "Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) processes (35\u201337).
