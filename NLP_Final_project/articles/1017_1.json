You and I may disagree on", "that. But under the Constitution, there was a mechanism for us to resolve", "our disagreements, which is if you wanna change the marriage laws of your", "state, the Constitutional mechanism is to convince your fellow citizens to", "change the marriage laws. Now, what that might mean is that some states,", "California, New York, maybe they would go one way.
