In addition, there is variability among", "ecosystem types, both freshwater (37) and marine and estuarine (32), in", "how quickly these systems and biota within them respond to changes in", "deposition. As described previously, our analysis focuses on changes to", "mercury in surface reservoirs, and accounting for these effects could", "increase benefits estimates by \u223c30%.

Dietary choices,", "including fish selection and consumption rate, can have a potentially", "larger influence on the ratio of benefits from global compared with", "domestic action than substantial scientific uncertainties about mercury\u2032s", "environmental behavior.

Fish consumption, and specific", "fish selection, can have substantial benefits, both nutritional (58, 59)", "and sociocultural (60).

Even with such adaptive approaches, there is continued need to", "mitigate future emissions.", "Although uncertainties related to chemical speciation of emissions", "reductions led to the smallest range in cumulative benefits for the", "Minamata scenario, interactions between these uncertainties and", "variabilities in dietary fish source could affect the relative benefits of", "global versus domestic action.
