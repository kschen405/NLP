Data for California and Oklahoma were estimated", "before 1998; however, data for nonreporting states have not been", "estimated since 1997. Third, data provided to state or area health", "departments by providers might be incomplete (57).

Additionally, the", "abortion total for 2000 provided to CDC by central health agencies", "are 20% lower than that reported for 2000 (the most recent year for", "which data are available) for the same reporting areas by The Alan", "Guttmacher Institute, a private organization that contacts abortion", "providers directly (58). A previous report documented a discrepancy", "of approximately 12% (59); the reasons for this larger discrepancy", "are unclear. Finally, because not all states collected or reported", "data on all characteristics (e.g., age, race, and the number of", "weeks' gestation) of women obtaining a legal induced abortion in", "2001, the numbers, rates, and ratios derived in this analysis might", "not be representative of all women who obtained abortions.", "Public Health Actions", "Despite these limitations, findings from ongoing national", "surveillance of legal induced abortion are useful for at least six", "purposes. First, public health agencies use data from abortion", "surveillance to identify characteristics of women who are at high", "risk for unintended pregnancy. Second, ongoing annual surveillance", "is used to monitor trends in the number, ratio, and rate of", "abortions in the United States.

Fourth,", "abortion and pregnancy rates can be used to evaluate the", "effectiveness of family planning programs and programs for", "preventing unintended pregnancy. Fifth, ongoing surveillance", "provides data for assessing changes in clinical practice patterns", "related to abortion (e.g., longitudinal changes in the types of", "procedures and trends in weeks of gestation at the time of", "abortion).
