"Wednesday, March 15, 2017", "Remarks as Prepared for Delivery", "Good morning, everyone.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I want to begin by thanking Dana [Boente] for", "coming down to Richmond and introducing me today.\u00a0\u00a0Dana is currently", "wearing two hats, serving as acting Deputy Attorney General while also", "continuing to serve as your U.S. Attorney here in the Eastern District of", "Virginia.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m grateful for his outstanding service in both roles.", "I also want to welcome the many federal, state and local law enforcement", "leaders who have joined us.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for everything you and your people", "do.\u00a0\u00a0I look forward to meeting with you this morning.", "All of us who work in law enforcement want to keep people safe.\u00a0\u00a0That is", "the heart of our jobs; it is what drives us every day.\u00a0\u00a0So we are all", "disturbed to learn that violent crime is on the rise in America,", "especially in our cities.\u00a0\u00a0And that is what I want to talk about with you", "today.", "First, we should keep in mind some context.\u00a0\u00a0Overall, crime rates in our", "country remain near historic lows.\u00a0\u00a0Murder rates are half of what they", "were in 1980.\u00a0\u00a0The rate of violent crime has fallen by almost half from", "its peak.", "The people of Richmond have seen this progress firsthand.\u00a0\u00a0Since 1995,", "murder and violent crime rates in Richmond have fallen by two-thirds.\u00a0\u00a0You", "have watched neighborhoods that were once in the grip of gangs and drugs", "transformed into places where kids can play and parents can take walks", "after sunset without fear.", "In the past four decades, we have won great victories against crime in", "America.\u00a0\u00a0This happened under leadership from both political parties, and", "thanks above all to the work of prosecutors and good police using", "data-driven methods and professional training.\u00a0\u00a0Hundreds of thousands of", "Americans are alive today as a result.", "But in the last two years, we\u2019ve seen warning signs that this progress is", "now at risk.", "The latest FBI data tell us that from 2014 to 2015, the violent crime rate", "in the U.S. increased by more than 3 percent \u2013 the largest one-year", "increase since 1991.\u00a0\u00a0The murder rate increased 10 percent \u2013 the largest", "increase since 1968.\u00a0\u00a0And all of this is taking place amid an", "unprecedented epidemic of heroin and opioid abuse.", "If this was just a one-year spike in violent crime, we might not worry too", "much.\u00a0\u00a0But the preliminary data for the first half of 2016 confirmed these", "trends.\u00a0\u00a0The number of violent crimes in the first half of last year was", "more than 5 percent higher than the same period in 2015.\u00a0\u00a0The number of", "murders was also up 5 percent, and aggravated assaults rose as", "well.\u00a0\u00a0Since 2014, the murder rate has gone up in 27 of our country\u2019s 35", "largest cities.\u00a0\u00a0Homicide rates in Chicago, Baltimore, Milwaukee and", "Memphis have returned to levels not seen in two decades.\u00a0\u00a0Here in", "Richmond, the preliminary murder total for 2016 was 44 percent higher than", "the year before.", "These numbers should trouble all of us.\u00a0\u00a0Behind all the data are real", "people whose safety and lives are at stake \u2013 people like the good folks", "whose stories I will hear later this morning.\u00a0\u00a0Each victim of this recent", "spike in violent crime is someone\u2019s parent, or child, or friend.\u00a0\u00a0And", "every loss of a young life to guns or drugs is a tragedy we must work to", "prevent.", "My fear is that this surge in violent crime is not a \u201cblip,\u201d but the start", "of a dangerous new trend.\u00a0\u00a0I worry that we risk losing the hard-won gains", "that have made America a safer and more prosperous place.", "While we can hope for the best, we can\u2019t afford to be complacent.\u00a0\u00a0When", "crime rates move in the wrong direction, they can move quickly.", "We know this, because those of us above a certain age have lived it.\u00a0\u00a0In", "the early 1960s, crime began to rise in our country.\u00a0\u00a0By 1973, crime rates", "in almost every category had doubled over their levels just a decade", "before.\u00a0\u00a0As the \u201970s went on, levels of crime and violence that we once", "deemed unacceptably high became the \u201cnew normal\u201d in America.", "I lived through that dark time in our history.\u00a0\u00a0I dealt with its", "consequences every day as a prosecutor.\u00a0\u00a0And I can assure you:\u00a0\u00a0We do not", "want to go back to those days.\u00a0\u00a0We must act decisively at all levels \u2013", "federal, state and local \u2013\u00a0\u00a0to reverse this rise in violent crime and keep", "our people safe.", "Last month the President gave us clear direction, issuing three executive", "orders that direct the federal government to reduce crime and restore", "public safety.\u00a0\u00a0This task will be a top priority of the Department of", "Justice during my time as Attorney General.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019d like to talk briefly", "about how we\u2019re tackling this challenge.", "First, we\u2019re making sure the federal government focuses our resources and", "efforts on this surge in violent crime.\u00a0\u00a0Two weeks ago, I announced the", "formation of a Department of Justice Task Force on Crime Reduction and", "Public Safety.\u00a0\u00a0It includes crime reduction experts from throughout the", "Department of Justice, including the heads of the FBI, the ATF, the DEA", "and the U.S. Marshals Service.\u00a0\u00a0The task force will evaluate everything we", "are doing at the federal level.", "Second:\u00a0\u00a0We need to use every lawful tool we have to get the most violent", "offenders off our streets.", "In recent years, we have seen a significant shift in the priority given to", "prosecuting firearms offenders at the federal level.\u00a0\u00a0This trend will", "end.\u00a0\u00a0This Department of Justice will systematically prosecute criminals", "who use guns in committing crimes.", "Last week, I sent a memo to all our federal prosecutors, urging them to", "work closely with their federal, state, and local law enforcement partners", "to target the most violent offenders in their districts.\u00a0\u00a0Working", "together, we will determine which venue \u2013 federal or state \u2013 would best", "take these criminals off our streets immediately, and ensure they are", "properly punished for their crimes.", "Here in Richmond, you have given us an excellent model for how we can lock", "up violent criminals and reduce crime.", "During the spike in violent crime in the late \u201980s and early \u201990s,", "Richmond consistently had one of the top ten per-capita murder rates among", "American cities.\u00a0\u00a0In response, federal prosecutors worked with state and", "local law enforcement in 1997 to launch an innovative program called", "Project Exile.\u00a0\u00a0Its goal was to deter felons from carrying firearms, and", "to take off the streets those who were mostly likely to commit gun", "violence:\u00a0\u00a0criminals with guns.", "Over the decade that followed, murders and armed robberies in Richmond", "declined dramatically.\u00a0\u00a0A study published in the journal Criminology &", "Public Policy credited Project Exile with the reduction in gun homicides", "in Richmond.", "This Department of Justice will encourage more efforts like Project Exile", "in cities across America \u2013 coordinated strategies that bring together all", "levels of law enforcement to reduce gun crime and make our cities safer.", "Third:\u00a0\u00a0To turn back this rising tide of violent crime, we need to", "confront the heroin and opioid crisis in our nation \u2013 and dismantle the", "transnational cartels that bring drugs and violence into our", "neighborhoods.", "Our nation is in the throes of a heroin and opioid epidemic.\u00a0\u00a0Overdose", "deaths more than tripled between 2010 and 2014.\u00a0\u00a0According to the CDC,", "about 140 Americans on average now die from a drug overdose each", "day.\u00a0\u00a0That means every three weeks, we are losing as many American lives", "to drug overdoses as we lost in the 9/11 attacks.", "Illegal drugs are flooding across our southern border and into cities", "across our country, bringing violence, addiction, and misery.\u00a0\u00a0We have", "also seen an increase in the trafficking of new, low-cost heroin by", "Mexican drug cartels working with local street gangs.\u00a0\u00a0As the market for", "this heroin expands, gangs fight for territory and new customers and", "neighborhoods are caught in the crossfire.", "There are three main ways to fight the scourge of drugs:\u00a0\u00a0criminal", "enforcement, treatment and prevention.", "Criminal enforcement is essential to stop both the transnational cartels", "that ship drugs into our country, and the thugs and gangs who use violence", "and extortion to move their product.\u00a0\u00a0One of the President\u2019s executive", "orders directed the Justice Department to dismantle these organizations", "and gangs \u2013 and we will do just that.", "Treatment programs are also vital.\u00a0\u00a0But treatment often comes too late to", "save people from addiction or death.", "So we need to focus on the third way we can fight drug use:\u00a0\u00a0preventing", "people from ever taking drugs in the first place.", "I realize this may be an unfashionable belief in a time of growing", "tolerance of drug use.\u00a0\u00a0But too many lives are at stake to worry about", "being fashionable.\u00a0\u00a0I reject the idea that America will be a better place", "if marijuana is sold in every corner store.\u00a0\u00a0And I am astonished to hear", "people suggest that we can solve our heroin crisis by legalizing marijuana", "\u2013 so people can trade one life-wrecking dependency for another that\u2019s only", "slightly less awful.\u00a0\u00a0Our nation needs to say clearly once again that", "using drugs will destroy your life.", "In the \u201980s and \u201990s, we saw how campaigns stressing prevention brought", "down drug use and addiction.\u00a0\u00a0We can do this again.\u00a0\u00a0Educating people and", "telling them the terrible truth about drugs and addiction will result in", "better choices.\u00a0\u00a0We can reduce the use of drugs, save lives and turn back", "the surge in crime that inevitably follows in the wake of increased drug", "abuse.", "Finally:\u00a0\u00a0The federal government alone cannot meet the challenge of", "violent crime and drugs \u2013 so we need to protect and support our brave men", "and women in law enforcement.\u00a0\u00a0About 85 percent of all law enforcement", "officers in our nation are not federal, but state and local.\u00a0\u00a0These are", "the men and women on the front lines \u2013 the ones doing most of the tough", "and often dangerous work that keeps our neighborhoods safe.", "Unfortunately, in recent years law enforcement as a whole has been", "unfairly maligned and blamed for the unacceptable deeds of a few bad", "actors.\u00a0\u00a0Too many of our officers, deputies, and troopers believed the", "political leadership of this country abandoned them.\u00a0\u00a0Amid this intense", "public scrutiny and criticism, their morale has gone down, while the", "number of police officers killed in the line of duty has gone up.", "Many of you who are law enforcement leaders have also told us that in this", "age of viral videos and targeted killings of police, something has changed", "in policing.\u00a0\u00a0Some law enforcement personnel are more reluctant to get out", "of their squad cars and do the proactive, up-close police work that builds", "trust and prevents violent crime.\u00a0\u00a0In some cities, arrests have fallen", "even as murder rates have surged.", "This is a terrible place to be, because we know that tough and", "professional law enforcement can make a real difference.\u00a0\u00a0It can reduce", "crime and save lives.\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ve seen it happen in our country over the past", "four decades.", "To turn back rising crime, we must rely heavily on all of you in state and", "local law enforcement to lead the way\u00a0\u2013 and you must know that you have", "our steadfast support.\u00a0\u00a0The federal government should use its money,", "research, and expertise to help you figure out what is happening and", "determine the best ways to fight crime.\u00a0\u00a0We should strengthen partnerships", "between federal and state and local officers.\u00a0\u00a0And we should encourage the", "proactive policing that keeps our neighborhoods safe.\u00a0\u00a0This Department of", "Justice will do just that.", "The new challenge of violent crime in our nation is real \u2013 and the task", "that lies before us is clear.\u00a0\u00a0We need to resist the temptation to ignore", "or downplay this crisis.\u00a0\u00a0Instead, we must tackle it head-on, to ensure", "justice and safety for all Americans.", "We will enforce our laws and put bad men behind bars.\u00a0\u00a0We will fight the", "scourge of drug abuse.\u00a0\u00a0And we will support the brave men and women of law", "enforcement, as they work day and night to protect us.", "Together, let us act to meet this challenge, so that our children will not", "look back and say that we let slip from our grasp all we had done to make", "America a safer place.", "Thank you for having me here in Richmond today.\u00a0\u00a0I look
