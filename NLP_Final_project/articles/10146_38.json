(2007)", "scenario, approximately 550\u00a0ppm CO_2, than in RCP4.5, approximately", "525\u00a0ppm CO_2. RCP4.5 also employed updated historical data series by", "calibrating to the year 2000 consensus emissions inventories from Lamarque", "et al. (2010), and the HYDE crop and pasture land use history (Klein", "Goldewijk et al. 2010) as well as implementing a new representation of", "residue biomass supply (Gregg and Smith 2010).
