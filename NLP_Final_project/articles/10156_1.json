That's how fed up they are. How do you respond to that?", "SEC. HILLARY CLINTON:", "Well, first of all, I have 2 million more votes than Donald Trump. And I", "think voters, as opposed to, you know, the kind of back and forth in the", "public arena, when voters show up to vote, they take that vote seriously.", "And yes, I know he has a plurality of Republicans who have voted for him.", "But I think in the course of this campaign, we are going to demonstrate he", "has no ideas.

A future you", "can believe in. Obviously, Donald Trump with the Make America Great again,", "is one of these slogans that has taken off, for better or for worse. If", "you could sum up, what is the big idea of your candidacy?", "SEC. HILLARY CLINTON:", "Look, we are stronger together. We are stronger together, in facing our", "internal challenges and our external ones. We are stronger together if we", "work to improve the economy. And that's going to mean trying to get the", "Republicans to do what will actually help produce more jobs, like we saw", "in the 1990s. We are stronger together when we have a bipartisan, even", "nonpartisan foreign policy that protects our country. And that provides a", "kind of steady, strong, smart leadership that the rest of the world", "expects from us.", "And I know that, you know, slogans come and go, and all the rest of it.", "But when I look at where we are in our country together, we need to unify", "the country. We are stronger together, when we act on a set of plans and", "priorities that will redound to the benefit of the American people.", "CHUCK TODD:", "How do you do it? You're a polarizing figure right now, in American", "politics. You have an unfavorable rating that is almost as high as Donald", "Trump's. How do you do it?", "SEC. HILLARY CLINTON:", "Well, it's not as high. And I--", "CHUCK TODD:", "No, it's not. But it\u2019s pretty high--", "SEC. HILLARY CLINTON:", "Well, look, if you got-- but he's done-- he's gotten--", "CHUCK TODD:", "You're pretty polarizing. He's polarizing.", "SEC. HILLARY CLINTON:", "Well--", "CHUCK TODD:", "How do you do it, if you're elected president? This is a polarized", "country.", "SEC. HILLARY CLINTON:", "Just the way-- just the way I did it when I was first lady, senator, and", "secretary of state. When I have these jobs, Chuck, I actually get things", "done. And I work with people across the aisle. Honestly, I worked with", "Republicans in the '90s to create the Children's Health Insurance Program.", "And I worked with Tom DeLay, the Hammer in the House, to reform adoption", "and foster care.

So I have a track record.", "And I'm going to remind people of that. Because it's not just rhetoric,", "for me. When I was secretary of state, I had a very high approval rating,", "as you can go back and check. Because I was doing a job that people could", "see. When I get into the arena, and all of the negativity that's been", "thrown at me for 25 years is recycled and put out there, I know I've got", "work to do. But I'm very confident that it's going to be successful.", "CHUCK TODD:", "I know we're over, but I got a couple more questions. Number one, you said", "Bill Clinton, you were going to basically put him in charge of getting", "this economy going again. What does that mean?", "SEC. HILLARY CLINTON:", "Well, what I said--", "CHUCK TODD:", "What did you mean?", "SEC. HILLARY CLINTON:", "--well, what I said in Kentucky and West Virginia is that there are parts", "of our country that have been left out and left behind for too long.

You know, every first lady has taken on special projects. And I", "think my husband's understanding of how to get this economy moving in", "places that have been left behind will be incredibly valuable.", "CHUCK TODD:", "Both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have been running against some of the", "economic policies of the '90s. Trade, Wall Street deregulation, things", "like that. Does that concern you?", "SEC. HILLARY CLINTON:", "Well, they're not running against 23 million new jobs. They're not running", "against incomes going up for every American, not just those at the top.", "They're not running against median family income going up 17 percent, and", "for African-Americans 33 percent, and living more people out of poverty.", "And ending up with a balanced budget and a surplus.", "Now, I have said I want to renegotiate NAFTA. I voted against the only", "multinational trade deal that came before me when I was in the Senate. I", "have stated my opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, based on what", "it was negotiated to include.", "So I'm more than happy to take on that argument. But I ask people, when", "you criticize the '90s, what do they criticize? The peace, or the", "prosperity? Because I think a lot of Americans, as I travel around the", "country, think of that as being a time when they thought they were getting", "ahead. Then we ran smack dab into the failed Republican economic policy.", "CHUCK TODD:", "And I know you're not going to reveal how you're vetting for a running", "mate.

HILLARY CLINTON:", "Well, the most important thing is to pick someone who you have absolute", "confidence in can be president. That's more important than any", "characteristic. And then someone you can work with. Someone that you", "believe will be a good partner, not just to you, but to the rest of the", "government.

HILLARY CLINTON:", "Yes. Yes--", "CHUCK TODD:", "I did a interview with him earlier. He expressed serious interest. If you", "called him up and said, \"I want to vet you to be my running mate,\" he'd", "listen. What do you say to that?", "SEC. HILLARY CLINTON:", "I think we should look widely and broadly. It's not just people in", "elective office. It is successful businesspeople. I am very interested in", "that. And I appreciate his openness to it. I think that--", "CHUCK TODD:", "You do plan on having people that maybe have never served in elected", "office, that you're going to vet--", "SEC. HILLARY CLINTON:", "I am absolutely intending to look far and wide. And I think that is the", "best way to find somebody who can really capture what's needed in the", "country, and businesspeople have, especially successful businesspeople who", "are really successful as opposed to pretend successful, I think have a lot", "to offer.", "CHUCK TODD:", "Pretend successful? You don't think--", "SEC. HILLARY CLINTON:", "Yeah.", "CHUCK TODD:", "--is there anything Donald Trump's done that you think should be praised?", "SEC. HILLARY CLINTON:", "I think he needs to release his tax returns. The only two we have show", "that he hasn't paid a penny in taxes. And yet he goes around talking about", "\"Make America great.\" You know? That means paying for our military. That", "means paying for our roads. That means paying for the V.A. That means a", "lot of things. And if you've got someone running for president who's", "afraid to release his tax returns, because it will expose the fact that he", "pays no federal income tax, I think that's a big problem.", "CHUCK TODD:", "No, my question was there's nothing about his background that is", "praiseworthy?", "SEC. HILLARY CLINTON:", "We'll find out. Because we have to get below the hype. We have to find", "what the reality is. And--", "CHUCK TODD:", "You don't feel like you know that?", "SEC.

She's", "been dragged all over this-- nomination process by an 80-- a", "near-octogenarian socialist who honeymooned in Russia and can't put him", "away. (LAUGHTER)", "And so, you know, something that says it a little stronger is probably a", "good idea for her. But she\u2019s displayed-- now she's chosen her president to", "bail her out, and her husband, former president, to bail her out on the", "economy, handing him half the portfolio?

And, you know, look you can't change", "who you are. She is who she is. And I think that she realizes that.

I mean the bumper sticker version", "that she's come with, as Alex mentioned, is better than, not as high as", "Donald Trump's on favorability numbers, which is the other thing that she", "was suggesting. But no, I think that to me, what's so striking about that,", "the poll you mentioned before, was the unfavorability numbers between her", "and Trump. And that we've seen that she's at 54 and that Trump is at 58, I", "think these are record highs.", "CHUCK TODD:", "Record highs. Yeah. They're record highs. And we've actually done", "something even more fun. And you'll love this, Alex, and Helene, there's", "19 percent of our survey that is unfavorable to both candidates. So", "there's your swing vote, right? So who are these people? Here's what's", "amazing. I'm going to show you this.
