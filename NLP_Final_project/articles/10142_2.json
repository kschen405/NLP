More specifically, the average premiums per policy in the", "nongroup market in 2016 would be roughly $5,800 for single policies (up", "from $5,500 under current law) and $15,200 for family policies (up from", "$13,100 under current law).", "In other words, Pence is right that for some of this subset of Americans,", "their premiums could rise as much as 13 percent.", "But Pence fails to mention two key qualifiers.", "First, as the CBO report notes, the majority of nongroup enrollees (about", "57 percent) would receive federal insurance subsidies, which on average", "would cover about two-thirds of the total premium. So for nongroup people", "getting subsidies, the amount they'd pay in premiums would be about 57", "percent lower, on average, than what they would pay for nongroup coverage", "under current law.", "There's another flaw in Pence's statement. He says families would pay", "$2,100 more to keep \"their current health care.\" In fact, much of what is", "driving up the cost of premiums in the nongroup market is that the", "government would require insurance companies in the exchange to offer a", "broader scope of benefits than most individual plans now include, an", "\"essential health benefits\" package that would match the benefits provided", "in most employer plans.", "So new nongroup policies would be required to cover a lot of things they", "don't currently cover -- things like maternity care, prescription drugs,", "and mental health and substance abuse treatment. Bottom line, it may cost", "more, but those people will be getting more insurance, and their", "out-of-pocket expense for medical needs should be smaller. According to", "the CBO report, an \"apples to apples\" comparison of the average price of", "equivalent insurance under the Democrats' plan would translate to an", "average premium of about 7 to 10 percent less than under current law.", "But our bigger problem with the Pence statement is the implication that", "the 13 percent rise in family health insurance premiums would apply to a", "larger group of people than it actually would. He says it would", "dramatically raise healthcare costs on working families.", "For the vast majority of people -- the five out of six nonelderly people", "who get their insurance through their employer -- the Democrats' plan", "would have a much smaller effect on premiums, the CBO concluded.
