Description of System: For", "each year since 1969, CDC has compiled abortion data received from 52 reporting areas: 50 states, the District of Columbia, and New York City. Results: In 1993, 1,330,414 legal abortions were reported to CDC, representing a 2.1% decrease from the", "number reported for 1992; in 1994, 1,267,415 abortions were reported, representing a 4.7% decrease from the number for 1993.

This report is based primarily on abortion data for 1993 and 1994 provided to CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division of Reproductive Health.", "METHODS", "For 1993 and 1994, CDC compiled data from 52 reporting areas: 50 states, the District of Columbia, and New York City. The total number of legal induced abortions was available from all reporting areas; however, not all these areas collected", "information regarding the characteristics of women who obtained abortions, and the number of states reporting each characteristic differed. States were excluded from the analysis if data regarding a given characteristic were unknown for greater", "than 15% of women.", "For 47 reporting areas, data concerning the number and characteristics of legal induced abortions were provided from the central health agency *; for the other five areas, data concerning the number of abortions were provided from hospitals and", "other medical facilities. Because information concerning the residence of women who obtained abortions was not available from some states, the procedures were reported by the state in which they were performed. However, two reporting areas (the", "District of Columbia and Wisconsin) reported abortions by state of residence; occurrence data were unavailable for those areas.", "For the analysis of age, women who obtained legal induced abortions were grouped by 5-year age groups. Both ratios (i.e., the number of abortions per 1,000 live births per year) and rates (the number of abortions per 1,000 women per year) are", "presented by age group in this report. Ratios were calculated by using the number of live births provided by each state's central health agency (except where noted), and rates were calculated by using the number of women reported in special", "unpublished tabulations provided by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. Because almost all (94%) abortions among women less than 15 years of age are obtained by those aged 13-14 years (1), the population of women aged 13-14 years was used as the", "denominator for calculating abortion rates for women aged less than 15 years. Rates for women aged greater than or equal to 40 years were based on the number of women aged 40-44 years, whereas rates for all women who obtained abortions were based", "on the population of women aged 15-44 years.", "Race was categorized by either three groups (i.e., a} white, b} black, and c} all other races) or two groups (i.e., a} white and b} black and all other races). \"Other\" races included Asian/Pacific Islander, Native American/Alaskan Native, and women", "classified as \"other\" race.", "In 1990, data regarding Hispanic ethnicity were first available on abortion reports submitted by central health agencies to CDC.

The abortion ratio had increased steadily from 1970 through 1980, decreased slightly during 1981-1983, increased to its highest level in 1984, then remained fairly stable until 1987, before beginning to decline (Table_2 , (Figure_1).", "This decline in the abortion-to-live-birth ratio probably resulted from several complex factors, such as reduced access to abortion services, changes in contraceptive practices, attitudinal changes concerning abortion and/or carrying unplanned", "pregnancies to term, and the decreased number of unintended pregnancies (9-12).", "Induced abortion rates in the United States for 1993-1994 were a) higher than rates reported previously by Australia and Western European countries and b) lower than rates reported by China, Cuba, Eastern European countries, and the New Independent", "States of the former Soviet Union (13). In addition, for 1994, the legal induced abortion rate in Canada was exactly half the rate in the United States (10.5 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 years vs. 21 per 1,000, respectively), and the", "abortion-to-live-birth ratio in Canada also was approximately half the ratio in the United States (186 abortions per 1,000 live births vs. 321 per 1,000, respectively) (14). Both abortion rates and birth rates among teenagers have been higher in", "the United States than in most Western European countries and some Eastern European countries (15).", "As in previous years, the abortion ratio in 1993 and 1994 differed substantially by age (2,6). Although the abortion ratio was highest for adolescents, the percentage of legal induced abortions obtained by women aged less than or equal to 19 years", "decreased steadily from the mid-1980s through 1994 (i.e., from 26% in 1984 to 22% in 1990 and to 20% in 1994) (7,16).

In 1994, the abortion ratio for women aged 15-19 years was the lowest ratio CDC had ever recorded for that age group. Other studies indicated a decrease in pregnancies among women aged 15-19 years during 1991-1992", "(17). Factors such as an overall decrease in the number of abortions, changing access to abortion services (10), and ongoing changes in abortion laws (e.g., parental consent or notification laws and mandatory waiting periods) -- all of which are", "likely to disproportionately affect adolescents -- could have affected this decline in the abortion ratio (18,19).", "In 1993 and 1994, the abortion ratio for black women was more than twice the ratio for white women, and this differential has increased since 1986. In addition, the abortion rate for black women was approximately three times the rate for white", "women. Race-specific differences in legal induced abortion ratios and rates may reflect differences in factors such as socioeconomic status, contraceptive use, incidence of unintended pregnancies, and access to family planning and contraceptive", "services.", "The abortion-to-live-birth ratio for Hispanic women during 1993 and 1994 was slightly lower than that for non-Hispanic women. Other published reports indicate that pregnant Hispanic women are less likely than pregnant non-Hispanic women to obtain", "an abortion (20). However, the abortion rate per 1,000 Hispanic women was higher than the rate for non-Hispanic women, a finding that is consistent with several previously published reports (20,21). For women in all age groups, fertility was higher", "for Hispanic than for non-Hispanic women (8).", "For 1994, a total of 34 states, the District of Columbia, and New York City reported Hispanic ethnicity of women who obtained abortions.

These geographical areas represented approximately 44% of all reproductive-aged Hispanic women", "in the United States during 1994 (CDC, unpublished data). One published report of a study that used abortion data obtained from CDC also suggests that the number of Hispanic women who obtain abortions may be underestimated (21).

The increasing reliance on D&E probably has resulted from the lower risk for complications associated with the procedure (29,30).", "Since CDC's surveillance of abortion mortality began in 1972, the annual number of deaths associated with legal induced abortion has decreased by 54% (as of 1991) (31). In 1972, 63 women died as a result of induced abortion. Of those deaths, 24", "were associated with legal abortion and 39 with illegal abortion. In 1991, 12 women died as a result of induced abortion: 11 of these deaths were associated with legal abortion and one with illegal abortion. The case-fatality rate decreased", "approximately 80% between 1972 (4.1 deaths per 100,000 legal induced abortions) and 1991 (0.8 deaths per 100,000 legal induced abortions). These rates, consistent with previously published data for the 1970s and mid-1980s (32-34) indicated that the", "risk for death from legal induced abortion continues to be extremely low.", "The numbers, ratios, and rates of abortion from this analysis are conservative estimates because the numbers of legal abortions reported to CDC for 1993 and 1994 were probably lower than the numbers actually performed. Totals provided by central", "health agencies are often lower than those obtained by direct surveys of abortion providers (2). For example, the total number of abortions reported to CDC for 1992 * was approximately 11% lower than that reported by The Alan Guttmacher Institute", "(AGI), a private organization that directly contacts abortion providers to obtain information concerning the number of abortions performed (11). However, since 1987, there has been a decrease in the percentage difference in the number of abortions", "reported to AGI compared with the number reported to CDC. In addition, not all states collected and/or reported information (e.g., age, race, and gestational age) concerning women who obtained a legal induced abortion during 1993 and 1994;", "therefore, the numbers, percentages, rates, and ratios derived from this analysis may not be representative of all women who obtained abortions in those years.", "Despite these limitations, findings from ongoing national surveillance of legal induced abortion are used for several purposes. First, data from abortion surveillance are used to identify characteristics of women at high risk for unintended", "pregnancy. Second, ongoing annual surveillance is essential to monitor trends in the number, ratio, and rate of abortions in the United States. Third, statistics on the number of pregnancies ending in abortion are used in conjunction with birth", "statistics to estimate pregnancy rates (e.g., pregnancy rates among teenagers) (1) and other outcome rates (e.g., the rate of ectopic pregnancies per 1,000 pregnancies). Fourth, abortion and pregnancy rates can be used to evaluate the effectiveness", "of family planning programs and programs for preventing unintended pregnancy. Fifth, ongoing surveillance provides data for assessing changes in clinical practice patterns related to abortion (e.g., longitudinal changes in the types of procedures", "and trends in gestational age at the time of abortion). Finally, these data are used as the denominator in calculating abortion morbidity and mortality rates.", "Induced abortions are linked usually to unintended pregnancies, which often occur despite use of contraception (19,35,36). In 1995, approximately 31% of live births to women aged 15-44 years were associated with unintended pregnancy (i.e., either", "mistimed or unwanted at conception) (12). In one study during 1994 and 1995, 58% of women who underwent an abortion reported that they \"currently used\" contraception during the month of their last menstrual period; however, the use of contraception", "might have been inconsistent or incorrect (21). Therefore, education regarding improved contraceptive practices, as well as access to and education regarding safe, effective, and low-cost contraception and family planning services, can help reduce", "the incidence of unintended pregnancy and, therefore, reduce the use of legal induced abortion in the United States (37).", "Recently passed welfare-reform legislation -- the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 *", "* may increase the interest in accurate state-based surveillance of induced abortion. In addition, some states have recently instituted programs that emphasize the prevention of unintended pregnancy, particularly among adolescents. To help guide", "these efforts, an ongoing, accurate assessment of induced abortion is needed in all states to determine the number and characteristics of women who obtain these procedures.", "Additional statistical and epidemiologic information about legal induced abortions is available from CDC's automated Reproductive Health Information System.
