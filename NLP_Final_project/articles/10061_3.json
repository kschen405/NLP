I can speak clearly to what America's strategic", "objectives were in providing this defensive weapons -- weaponry to the", "people of Ukraine.", "STEPHANOPOULOS: So, do you agree, then, with Senator Murkowski that it", "would have been inappropriate to withhold the military aid unless this", "political investigation was pursued?", "POMPEO: George, it -- I'm -- I'm telling you what I was involved with.
