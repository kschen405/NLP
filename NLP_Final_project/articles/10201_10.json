There are $2.3", "billion of tax credits available and a tight September 16 deadline for", "preliminary applications.", "Subscribe", "This alert considers one of the truly new provisions of the American", "Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) with extraordinary", "potential\u2014new Section 48C of the Tax Code, which provides $2.3 billion of", "potential tax credits for \u201cqualifying advanced energy projects,\u201d i.e.,", "manufacturing facilities related to renewables. On August 13, in Notice", "2009-72, the Treasury provided guidance and some of the forms relevant to", "the new credits.", "Unlike many of the credits that we\u2019ve discussed in other Renewable Energy", "Alerts, the 48C credit is distinguished in several ways:", "* It\u2019s competitive. An applicant will have to submit a successful", "application to qualify for the credit. The Treasury expects about 1000", "applications.", "* It has a very accelerated application process. As we discuss below,", "some parts of the application have a very short application period. In", "particular, the preliminary description of a project must be submitted", "to the Department of Energy by September 16, 2009.", "* It\u2019s a credit for investing in the manufacture of renewable energy", "equipment, not for the generation of renewable energy. The credit", "applies to new manufacturing facilities, as well as refurbishing or", "expanding existing facilities.", "* It\u2019s huge. The new credit is a hefty 30% of the equipment\u2019s cost, far", "larger than the somewhat similar 10% investment tax credit of the", "1980s.", "In this alert, we\u2019ll discuss the rules that apply to Section 48C and how", "we expect the credit to be administered. As you read this, remember one", "important consideration\u2014even once a project is awarded credits, this is", "only the beginning of the process. The project still has to be developed", "and placed in service substantially as it was described to the Treasury", "and the Department of Energy; the mere selection of a project does not", "assure that credits will actually be available to reduce tax liability.", "First, the basic rules:", "1. What is a tax credit? The balance of this alert is about Section 48C.", "If you know how credits work, then skip ahead to item 2, but, for", "those of you who would like an introduction, you can start here.", "A tax credit is a \u201cdollar for dollar\u201d reduction in tax liability.", "Suppose you earn $10 million and owe about $3.5 million in taxes (at a", "35% tax rate). A $1m tax credit would reduce your tax liability from", "$3.5 million to $2.5 million. This is better than a tax deduction,", "which is typically worth about 35 cents on the dollar (again,", "presuming a 35% tax rate). Of course, to use a tax credit, you have to", "be paying taxes, and the alternative minimum tax can limit the ability", "to use certain tax credits, including the Section 48C credit. Because", "many developer-owners of projects that are eligible for credits have", "relatively small liabilities for federal income tax, instead of", "claiming the credit themselves, they may partner with high-income", "taxpayers, transferring the tax credits to those partners in exchange", "for cash payments.", "Alternatively, the user-developer may arrange to transfer the property", "to a high-income taxpayer which will then lease it back to the", "user-developer at a lower rent than would otherwise apply, because the", "owner-lessor\u2019s costs have been reduced by the amount of the tax", "credit. For example, if the property costs $10 million, but it", "qualifies for a 30% tax credit, then the owner-lessor\u2019s effective cost", "is only $7 million. With lower costs, the investor-owner can charge", "the user-developer less rent and still cover its other costs.", "Tax credits are subject to an array of rules, some of which apply even", "if the user of the credit property keeps it for itself and doesn\u2019t", "involve an \u201cinvestor.\u201d Other rules apply if an investor is brought in", "to pay for the credit. It is important to remember that the tax rules", "almost never allow a credit to be \u201csold.\u201d Instead, the investor has to", "participate in a partnership, limited liability company, or leasing", "arrangement structured as a conventional business transaction, and", "claim the credit as an owner (or, in some cases, as a tenant). When", "these structures are used, special tax structuring is required: (i) if", "the credits are allocated to a partnership, special rules govern how", "the credits are shared among the partners; (ii) typically, the", "investor has to have a \u201cprofit motive,\u201d meaning that it has to have an", "expectation of receiving back more cash and tax credits than its cash", "investment; and (iii) there is a need for \u201cexit strategies\u201d for", "getting the investor out of the deal. And many tax credits, including", "this one, are subject to \u201crecapture\u201d if the property is transferred or", "destroyed within the first five years after it is placed in service.", "So, it is important to plan out what will be happening with the", "project over that time period. Finally, since the mid-1980s, when", "significant changes were made to the Tax Code, credits are generally", "not as valuable to individuals as they are to corporations. As a", "result, the latter are far more likely to be investors.", "2. Overview of Section 48C. The qualifying advanced energy project credit", "is not found in the section that provides the credit for producing", "energy from solar, wind, geothermal, and other renewables that we have", "discussed in several recent Nixon Peabody alerts. It\u2019s an entirely new", "and different credit based on placing manufacturing equipment in", "service. Importantly, Section 48C does not have a grant option. As a", "result, if the developer-user of the facility cannot use the credit on", "its own, then credit monetization structures, such as partnerships or", "leasing, will be necessary.", "Because the Section 48C credit does not apply to a building or its", "structural components, investor structures may involve only the", "equipment portion of the facility generating the credit, and not the", "\u201centire\u201d facility.", "3. What qualifies. The credit applies to a newly defined term,", "\u201cqualifying advanced energy project,\u201d which is a project selected by", "Treasury that re-equips, expands, or establishes a manufacturing", "facility for the production of:", "* property used to produce energy from renewable resources;", "* fuel cells and microturbines;", "* an energy storage system for use with electric or hybrid motor", "vehicles;", "* electric grids to support the transmission or storage of", "intermittent sources of renewable energy;", "* property designed to capture and sequester carbon dioxide", "emissions;", "* property designed to refine or blend renewable fuels (but not", "property which is used in the refining or blending of any", "transportation fuel other than renewable fuels);", "* property designed to produce energy conservation technologies", "(including energy-conserving lighting and smart grid);", "* certain electric vehicles described in Sections 30(d) and 30D of", "the Tax Code, and components designed specifically for use with", "such vehicles; or", "* other advanced energy property designed to reduce greenhouse gas", "emissions as determined by the Treasury.", "The notice provides two additional considerations:", "* to qualify as manufacturing, the facility must \u201cmake or process", "raw materials into finished products (or accomplish any", "intermediate stage in that process)\u201d and", "* qualifying property must be \u201cnecessary for the production of", "specified advanced energy property.\u201d", "Thus, based on the foregoing, we wouldn\u2019t expect furniture or", "typewriters used by administrative or sales staff to qualify for the", "credit.", "4. The credit is competitive. The government is seeking applications to", "compete for the award of Section 48C credits. Projects will be ranked", "by the Department of Energy, and then the Treasury will complete the", "process by awarding credits to those projects on DOE\u2019s list, in order,", "until the $2.3 billion of credits has been exhausted. Certain basic", "criteria are important\u2014first, credits can be awarded only to projects", "where there is a reasonable expectation of commercial viability.", "Furthermore, the Treasury is directed to choose the projects that meet", "several evaluation criteria. These are enumerated in the notice, as", "follows:", "* greatest direct and indirect domestic job creation during the", "period February 17, 2009 through February 17, 2013;", "* greatest net impact in avoiding or reducing air pollutants and", "greenhouse gases;", "* greatest potential for technological innovation and commercial", "deployment, based on three subfactors, the production of new or", "significantly improved technologies, improvements in levelized", "costs or performance, and \u201cmanufacturing significance and value\u201d;", "* shortest project time from certification to completion.", "A fifth factor identified in the Code, lowest cost of generated or", "stored energy, reduction in energy consumption, or greenhouse gas", "emission, is not listed with the others in the notice.", "The notice grafts some additional scoring criteria onto this process,", "which it refers to as \u201cprogram policy factors\u201d and which are ranked", "equally:", "* geographic diversity", "* technology diversity", "* project size diversity, and", "* regional economic development.", "Finally, although this factor does not appear in the statute, the", "application materials do call for an applicant to compute energy and", "environmental impacts \u201cper tax credit dollar.\u201d So, it will likely be", "important for an applicant to be efficient in structuring and pricing", "its project.", "How it will actually work:", "1. The need for speed. When Jim Duffy and I met with the Treasury in", "July, it was apparent that the Treasury was directed to get the", "Section 48C process underway quickly. They were concerned that", "dividing the $2.3 billion in tax credits into multiple rounds of", "applications, or reserving credits for particular industries, might", "delay deployment of this credit or leave some of it unused if a", "particular industry did not pursue credits or score well in the", "application process. Consistent with this view, the Treasury\u2019s", "guidance is based on a single round of applications, with more rounds", "only if the credits fail to be fully italicized, and very short", "deadlines that will require taxpayers to act very quickly if they want", "to compete for the Section 48C credit.", "The first deadline arrives in the very near future: an applicant must", "submit a short, preliminary application, identifying the kind of", "project, its current status, and milestones for completion; this is", "due to the Department of Energy by September 16, 2009. Next comes a", "far lengthier \u201cfinal\u201d application, with a detailed business plan and", "projections. This is due just one month later, on October 16. It\u2019s not", "clear, but it appears that October 16 is an applicant\u2019s last chance to", "describe how its project meets the 48C criteria. Finally, an", "application to the IRS must be submitted no later than December 16.", "The IRS has not yet published the form of this last application. Note", "that the Treasury decided against a rolling process for accepting", "applications. In other words, it\u2019s crucial that each step of an", "application be submitted by its particular deadline, but it\u2019s not", "beneficial if it is received ahead of other applications.", "The Treasury has specifically incorporated the filing provisions that", "apply to tax returns in accepting applications. So, the use of a local", "post office or an approved delivery service may be the best way to", "assure that an application has met the deadlines. All applications", "must be signed under penalties of perjury by an authorized signer.", "2. Little flexibility. That doesn\u2019t mean that an application won\u2019t", "benefit from being completed as soon as possible. The notice is filled", "with reminders that the IRS will not be able to extend deadlines, that", "failure to include all required information may cause an application", "to be rejected, that significant changes in an actual project from the", "description that was submitted may result in denial or recapture of", "credits, and that there is no right to a conference or appeal.", "Treasury has adopted a broad standard on changing the project\u2014anything", "that a reasonable person would expect the Treasury or DOE to consider", "\u201csignificant\u201d must be brought to their attention. Overall, the", "Treasury has detailed a tough process, suggesting that asking lots of", "questions as early as possible, and trying to resolve any doubts", "before the deadlines will be important.", "3. Business plans and similar materials. DOE wants to see a lot of", "material in the October 16 application\u2014in particular, a business plan,", "the experience of an applicant\u2019s officers and directors, and its other", "sources of cash. In a lot of ways this looks just like the materials", "that companies provide to potential investors. Plainly, companies that", "have put thought into these materials and have them already prepared", "will have a large advantage.", "Companies that are in the preliminary stages, with a clever idea but", "little else, are not likely to do well in this process. It is", "generally expected that these materials will be submitted on a pair of", "duplicate CDs.", "4. The tax angles. Some taxpayers may be able to use the credit directly", "against their own tax liability, but others will want to use (i)", "partnership structures like we see for traditional renewable energy", "projects, and (ii) leasing structures, using both finance and", "\u201clease-passthrough\u201d (or \u201cinverted lease\u201d) structures.
