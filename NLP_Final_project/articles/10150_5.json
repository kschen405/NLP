One", "method would be to modify the benefit formula for determining the Primary", "Insurance Amount by making the second percentage factor (32%) be", "applicable to the lowest band of Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (instead", "of the 90% factor), but the reduction in benefits would not be larger than", "the pension from non-covered employment.
