A fourth day of searching has ended here. A fleet of", "planes from the U.S., from Australia, and New Zealand, four military, four", "civilian. The focus of their search is really twofold.

Bill, thanks so much. I'm joined", "now by Michael Chertoff, former Secretary of Homeland Security. Also by", "Bob Hager, a long-time aviation correspondent for NBC. Great to have both", "of you. Bob, let's pick up on what Bill is saying. The fact that there's", "debris that's scattered around, if you put it together, do you think", "that's significant?", "BOB HAGER:", "Well yes. I mean, they're starting to get a lot of satellite photos of", "this, and I wonder if they're all seeing the same pieces of debris. But", "you've got to hope that it's from this plane.", "DAVID GREGORY:", "Right, of course. And perhaps it is, perhaps it's not. But if that is, we", "have the current story about, you've got bad weather and wind, and it's", "all about finding the black box, which is actually not black. But you've", "got an example of one.", "BOB HAGER:", "Yeah, here's the box.", "DAVID GREGORY:", "Yeah.", "BOB HAGER:", "So yeah, so these pieces, they wouldn't tell you anything about the crash", "if they find them. But if you can trace them back through the currents,", "this would be the prize, getting these two black boxes. Here's what one", "looks like. This is a flight data recorder. Here's the important thing", "right there. That's the pinger. Sends out this underwater ping for a", "month, month and a half after the crash. If they don't, and then you can", "zero in, if you hear the pinger in the water.", "DAVID GREGORY:", "That's the thing though, is getting near enough to it. And this is a huge", "search area right now. How close do you have to be?", "BOB HAGER:", "Oh, you have to be about five, six miles, maybe even ten at the outside.", "So you've got to have a pretty good idea of where it is.

In this case, if we don't", "hear the pinger, I'm wondering if they'll ever find any of it.", "DAVID GREGORY:", "Mike Chertoff, look, this is just the primal fear that anybody has, that", "you're on an airplane that goes down or just vanishes. And it may sound", "like kind of a na\u00efve question, but in this age when we can find our iPhone", "with G.P.S. and all the rest, how do we lose sight of an aircraft?", "MICHAEL CHERTOFF:", "Well, I think one of the questions is whether the Malaysians were", "completely forthcoming at the very beginning about what they saw in terms", "of radar and, well, whether they held back information. So part of the", "problem is I think there was a scarcity of information at the beginning.", "And there may have been some misinformation, perhaps inadvertent. And", "that's made it a little more difficult.", "DAVID GREGORY:", "So what do you worry about now? There's a scenario that took place that", "we're trying to piece together. And after 9/11, when we thought so much", "about aviation security, are there new things that we need to learn from", "here?", "MICHAEL CHERTOFF:", "I think there are. Obviously one of the theories, but it's not proven yet,", "is that one or more of the pilots may have been involved in this. And of", "course, much of our screening has been focused on passengers.

Is that your view this morning?", "MIKE ROGERS:", "I think that's the highest probability, David. You can't take anything", "quite off the list yet.

So what they'll continue to", "do is try to identify every background on every passenger to make sure", "they're not missing something. And then they won't be really able to put", "this whole case together until they find the aircraft. And I do believe", "based on everything that I've seen so far, it is likely and probable that", "it crashed into the Indian Ocean.", "DAVID GREGORY:", "As you have been in Ukraine and are thinking about Vladimir Putin and", "Russia, the mission of U.S. intelligence is to think about what happens", "next. So what is President Putin going to do next?", "MIKE ROGERS:", "Well, that's the big mystery. But I will tell you that the Ukrainians", "passionately believe that he will be on the move again in Ukraine,", "especially in the East. And we have to think of it, I think we're a bit", "removed from this, David. I talked to an individual who was kidnapped by", "the Russians, he believes. His ear was cut off, he had nails put in his", "hand in a crucifix type of position in order to get a confession from him", "that the Americans were behind the upheaval in Ukraine.", "And this is who we're dealing with. So they took over Crimea, you see that", "they've taken over another base yet today. And it certainly appears by", "everything that Ukrainian intelligence officials believe, certainly U.S.", "intelligence officials believe that Putin is not done in Ukraine. And so", "it is very troubling.", "He's put all military units he would need to move into Ukraine on its", "Eastern border. And is doing exercises. We see him moving forces in the", "South in a position where they could take the southern region over to", "Moldova in the Ukraine. And we see that he's actually working what they", "call \"soft power.\" So he's got intelligence officials spread out all over", "the country causing problems in Ukraine.", "DAVID GREGORY:", "Do you think President Obama has done enough to stop him?", "MIKE ROGERS:", "I think Americans are so far removed from this. We need to re-engage in", "what is actually happening. You have individuals who are for independence", "and their own personal liberty, fighting against a country that wants to", "take them over. And one of the reasons they took to the streets in the", "beginning was corruption, oppressive corruption.", "I do think that we have to, as Americans, have to take a tough stand with", "our European partners. There are things that we can do that I think we're", "not doing. I don't think the rhetoric matches the reality on the ground.", "You can do noncombatant-military aid in a way that allows them to defend", "themselves. And that's all they want. No direct military action. They", "don't want U.S. boots on the ground, neither do I. I don't think you do", "either, nor does any other American.", "But what we can do is offer them things that they can use to really", "protect and defend themselves. And I think that sends a very clear", "message. We're not talking about even complicated weapon systems. We're", "talking about small arms so they can protect themselves. Maybe medical", "supplies, radio equipment, things that they can use to protect themselves,", "defensive-posture weapon systems.", "And you do that in conjunction with sanctions, now you've got something", "that says, \"Mr. Putin, we're done with you expanding into other", "countries.\" He goes to bed at night thinking of Peter the Great and he", "wakes up thinking of Stalin. We need to understand who he is and what he", "wants. It may not fit with what we believe of the 21st century.", "But that's not who he is and that's not what he's trying to accomplish. We", "need to be a little bit tougher with Putin or he is going to continue to", "take territory to fulfill what he believes is rightfully Russia.

I think it's too late. If he", "crosses into the Baltics with military units, that is more than troubling.", "That means that the country of Georgia is likely to have been more further", "invaded than it already is. It means that he's taken land in the Ukraine,", "the southern and eastern portions of Ukraine before I think he would do", "the Baltics.", "So if it gets to the Baltics, we have allowed people who want to be free,", "who want to be independent, who want to have self-determination, and we've", "turned our back and walked away from them.

He's called that absurd. No new details have come to", "light on this. Were you irresponsible in making such a charge without", "having specific evidence to back it up? To just sort of float that out", "there?", "MIKE ROGERS:", "Well, first of all, I see all the intelligence and all the evidence from", "everything from his activities leading up to this event to very suspicious", "activity during the event. And so when you talk to the folks who are doing", "the investigation, they cannot rule it out.", "So here's what we know, David. We know today no counterintelligence", "official in the United States does not believe that Mr. Snowden, the", "N.S.A. contractor, is not under the influence of Russian intelligence", "services. We believe he is. I certainly believe he is today. So now we all", "agree that he's under the influence of Russian intelligence services", "today.", "For the investigators, they need to figure out well, when did that", "influence start. And was he interested in cooperating earlier than the", "timeline would suggest. So you're talking to a guy who stole information,", "who is now in the arms of intelligence services saying, \"Well, gosh,", "whatever you guys say is absurd. Only I can define the truth.\" That's", "ridiculous on its face.", "I do believe there's more to this story. He is under the influence of", "Russian intelligence officials today. He is actually supporting in an odd", "way this very activity of brazen brutality and expansionism of Russia. He", "needs to understand that. And I think Americans need to understand that.", "We need to put it in proper context.", "DAVID GREGORY:", "But what is the evidence that he is under that influence? As he has", "pointed out, why go to Hong Kong? When he originally got to Russia, he was", "stranded in the airport. That's no way to treat a spy, he has pointed out.", "So you're arguing a lot, but where's the evidence to suggest that he's", "actually under the influence of a foreign intelligence agency?", "MIKE ROGERS:", "Well, again, today, we believe he's under the influence and every", "counterintelligence official believes that. You won't find one that", "doesn't believe today he's under the influence of Russian intelligence", "services. That we can all agree on. It's when did that start that there", "is-- I think there is really good evidence. In this case, as the more we", "look into this, I think the more you're going to find that that date gets", "further and further away from his story. Matter of fact, I don't believe", "the story he tells about both the airport or his activities in Hong Kong", "are accurate.", "It just gets more complicated and as I said he\u2019s clearly in Moscow, under", "the influence of intelligence services for a country that is expanding its", "borders today using military force. I think there\u2019s a lot more questions", "that need to be answered here.", "DAVID GREGORY:", "We're going to leave it there.

And a couple of things, our Congress has still not voted even on", "the basic Ukrainian economic package because of a dispute over the I.M.F.", "unrelated. That sends a terrible signal.

That this is an amateur", "athletic experience?", "REGGIE LOVE:", "Well, look, I think when you look at the coaches' salaries and you look at", "the money that universities are able to bring in from alumni, obviously", "college sports is a business. And that being said, I think it's hard to", "say that every player should be paid for their participation in a specific", "dollar amount, but I do think that student athletes are a key partner in", "the ecosystem.

These kids are 18,", "19 years old.", "DAVID GREGORY:", "They're not partners now, Mark, is the issue. They're actually not", "partners.

They can today,", "maybe not when you were playing, today, they can get a laptop from their", "athletic department. They can get a suit and tie from their athletic", "department.

The reality is,", "there is an element of professionalizing this, whether you're selling", "merchandise. If my son wants a Villanova jersey with Josh Hart's name on", "it, he can't get that. That's against the rules.", "MARK EMMERT:", "That's right.", "DAVID GREGORY:", "But I can buy the jersey with number three on it, and he's perfectly happy", "because he knows what that means.

So I guess what", "I'm asking is, what's the compromise? What can you commit to to say, \"We", "can close this gap a little bit\"?", "MARK EMMERT:", "Well, the gap needs to be closed around the context of being a student at", "a university. So if we provide the N.C.A.A. members, universities and", "colleges, provide a young man or a young woman with all the expenses they", "have, legitimate expenses as a student athlete, including this so-called", "stipend, right, that extra amount of money.", "I think that makes great sense and I think it'd be very valuable to the", "students, provide them with that, provide them with a commitment for a", "lifelong education, at least to finish that Bachelor's degree, they want", "to come back and finish? Great. Let them come back and finish. I think", "that's terrific. Making sure that they have the resources available to be", "successful so that they're set up for the rest of their life. That's what", "we want.", "SECRETARY ARNE DUNCAN:", "David, that's half the battle. The other half that I really want to", "emphasize is that the incentives for coaches are basically all wrong now.", "And Tom McMillen played in the NBA, Rhodes scholar, has done some", "fantastic work. In terms of coaches' compensation, he looked at a number", "of contracts. The dollar value was $11 in terms of additional bonuses for", "wins, and $1 for academic performance.", "And we see that place after place after place. For me, there should be a", "threshold academically. If students aren't performing at that and", "graduation rates, coaches shouldn't get anything. And if coaches are doing", "the wrong thing and cheating, the penalty should not just hit the", "university, the penalties need to follow the coach.", "DAVID GREGORY:", "Quick final word Reggie, about ten seconds left.", "REGGIE LOVE:", "Yeah, no, I agree with Arne. I think the incentives are dis-aligned. But I", "do think that there are some great coaches out there who are committed to", "the university, who are committed to the men and women on their teams. But", "I think there are also some bad apples out there as well.", "I think there are a lot of folks out there who look at this is a business", "and their main point is, \"How can I get paid?\" And if coaches had that", "attitude, it's hard for players not to have that attitude. And I think a", "great example is you look at tickets to a basketball game at a university.", "Definitely commercialized.", "A student athlete can't go out and sell his ticket that he gets as a", "student athlete at market value. But a university can tie a $10,000 alumni", "check to a season-ticket holder. They can get more than market value as a", "university for those tickets.
