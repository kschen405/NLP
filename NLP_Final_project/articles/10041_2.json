As they write, \u201cchanging a severe", "hurricane\u2019s name from Charley to Eloise could nearly triple its death", "toll\u201d.", "Why?", "The names certainly don\u2019t reflect a storm\u2019s severity, and they alternate", "genders from one to the next.", "Jung team thinks that the effect he found is due to unfortunate", "stereotypes that link men with strength and aggression, and women with", "warmth and passivity. Thanks to these biases, people might take greater", "precautions to protect themselves from Hurricane Victor, while reacting", "more apathetically to Hurricane Victoria. \u201cThese kinds of implicit biases", "routinely affect the way actual men and women are judged in society,\u201d says", "Sharon Shavitt, who helped to design the study. \u201cIt appears that these", "gender biases can have deadly consequences.\u201d", "But Jeff Lazo from the National Centre for Atmospheric Research disagrees.", "He\u2019s a social scientist and economist who has looked into the public", "communication of hurricane risk, and he thinks the pattern is most likely", "a statistical fluke, which arose because of the ways in which the team", "analysed their data.", "Let\u2019s look at each of these arguments in turn.", "First, Jung\u2019s team asked nine people to rate the name of US hurricane on a", "scale of 1 (very masculine) to 11 (very feminine). They found that the", "more feminine names were linked to more damage (normalised to today\u2019s", "value) and deaths. (They excluded Katrina because that was such a huge", "outlier.)", "To test their hypothesis about gender biases, the team ran six", "experiments. (For stats junkies, here\u2019s the table showing all the numbers", "behind the experiments; note that each one involves a fresh group of", "volunteers.)", "When the volunteers saw a list of hurricane names, and nothing more, they", "guessed that male storms would be more intense than female ones. After", "reading a more detailed scenario about an incoming hurricane, they", "predicted that the storm would be riskier and more intense if its name was", "Alexander rather than Alexandra.", "After reading another similar scenario, they were more likely to say that", "they would evacuate their homes if Hurricane Christopher was", "hypothetically bearing down upon them, than if Hurricane Christina was", "doing so. Likewise, if they read a voluntary evacuation order, they were", "more likely to comply in the face of Hurricanes Danny, Victor or Alexander", "than Hurricanes Kate, Victoria, or Alexandra respectively", "These differences aren\u2019t due to explicit sexism. When the team asked", "people directly if male or female hurricanes would be more dangerous, the", "responses were evenly split. \u201cThis suggests that the effects in the main", "experiments are implicit in nature,\u201d says Shavitt. In other words, gender", "stereotypes influence our thoughts and behaviour, whether or not we buy", "into them outright.", "But Lazo thinks that neither the archival analysis nor the psychological", "experiments support the team\u2019s conclusions. For a start, they analysed", "hurricane data from 1950, but hurricanes all had female names at first.", "They only started getting male names on alternate years in 1979. This", "matters because hurricanes have also, on average, been getting less deadly", "over time. \u201cIt could be that more people die in female-named hurricanes,", "simply because more people died in hurricanes on average before they", "started getting male names,\u201d says Lazo.", "Jung\u2019s team tried to address this problem by separately analysing the data", "for hurricanes before and after 1979. They claim that the findings", "\u201cdirectionally replicated those in the full dataset\u201d but that\u2019s a bit of a", "fudge. The fact is they couldn\u2019t find a significant link between the", "femininity of a hurricane\u2019s name and the damage it caused for either the", "pre-1979 set or the post-1979 one (and a \u201cmarginally significant", "interaction\u201d of p=0.073 doesn\u2019t really count). The team argues that", "splitting the data meant there weren\u2019t enough hurricanes in each subset to", "provide enough statistical power. But that only means we can\u2019t rule out a", "connection between gender and damage; we can\u2019t soundly confirm one either.", "Other aspects of the team\u2019s analysis didn\u2019t make sense to Lazo. For", "example, they included indirect deaths in their fatality counts, which", "includes people who, say, are killed by fallen electrical lines in the", "clean-up after a storm. \u201cHow would gender name influence that sort of", "fatality?\u201d he asks. He also notes that the damage a hurricane inflicts", "depends on things like how buildings are constructed, and other actions", "that we take long before a hurricane is named, or even before it forms.", "Then, there are the six experiments. As is common in psychology, the", "volunteers in the first three were all college students. \u201cThere is no", "reason to think that University of Illinois undergraduate students in", "hypothetical scenarios would have any relation to real-world decision", "making to populations in hurricane vulnerable areas,\u201d says Lazo. The", "participants in the last three were recruited via Amazon Mechanical", "Turk\u2014an online platform for finding volunteers.  Again, it\u2019s unclear how", "representative they were of people who live in coastal, hurricane-prone", "towns.", "Finally, Lazo says that there\u2019s a lot of evidence on how people respond to", "hurricane threats, and how their decisions are influenced by their social", "situation, vulnerability, culture, prior experience, sources of", "information, when the hurricane makes land, and so on. \u201cTrying to suggest", "that a major factor in this is the gender name of the event, with a very", "small sample of real events, is a very big stretch,\u201d says Lazo. And if the", "archival analysis isn\u2019t as strong as it originally seemed, then what the", "team has basically done is to show \u201cthat individuals respond to", "gender\u201d\u2014hardly a big deal. [Update: To clarify, I mean that there\u2019s", "already a huge amount of evidence that individuals respond to gender, not", "that the biases themselves are no big deal. Of course, they are.]", "All of this matters because Jung\u2019s conclusions, if they\u2019re right, could", "have implications for how hurricanes are described. \u201cIt may make sense to", "move away from human names, but other labels could also create problems if", "they are associated with perceptions of mildness or gentleness,\u201d says", "Shavitt. \u201cThe key is to provide information and labels that are relevant", "to the storm\u2019s severity.\u201d", "Lazo says, \u201cIf there\u2019s reasonable validity to their findings, it is worth", "further exploration with real hurricane-vulnerable subjects.
