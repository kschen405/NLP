The memo was written at the request of Senate Minority", "Leader Mark Miller, D-Monona.", "The memo projects that various tax provisions adopted in 2011 will result", "in a reduction of $2.33 billion in general fund tax revenue over 10 years.", "That appears to back the One Wisconsin Now claim.", "But the claim is a little more complicated than that -- it really has four", "elements:", "\"Walker\u2019s budget (1) includes tax breaks for corporations (2) and the rich", "(3) that will cost the state of Wisconsin taxpayers $2.3 billion over the", "next decade (4).\"", "1. \"Walker\u2019s budget\"", "The group says the $2.3 billion in tax breaks over 10 years is part of the", "2011-2013 budget that was proposed by Walker and modified and adopted by", "the Legislature. But the fiscal bureau reached its projection by", "considering tax breaks not only in the budget, but in five other", "business-related measures that were adopted by the Legislature early in", "2011.", "Ross conceded his group made a \"misstatement.\" He noted that less than two", "weeks earlier, his group had issued a news release that attributed the", "$2.3 billion figure to both the budget and the earlier action.", "One cautionary note.", "Todd Berry, president of the nonprofit Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, says", "it is difficult to project the effects of tax law changes over 10 years:", "\"It\u2019s so volatile, I just don\u2019t think you can forecast very far out.\"", "So, the first part of the claim is off because it cited only Walker\u2019s", "budget -- but that\u2019s relatively minor, since the budget built the earlier", "tax reductions into its assumptions.", "2. \"Tax breaks for corporations\"", "Ross pointed out that nearly $1.6 billion of the $2.3 billion tax breaks", "would go to corporations through three tax provisions.", "Tax cuts: On production earnings of manufacturers and agricultural", "businesses. The cuts would apply to small businesses as well as large", "corporations.

The focus of the Walker-called special session of", "the Legislature in January was on improving the state\u2019s business climate.", "3. Tax breaks for \"the rich\"", "Ross told us a \"a clear majority\" of the remaining $700 million in tax", "breaks will go to the \"rich.\"", "Of course, by saying \"clear majority,\" Ross is acknowledging not all of", "the remaining tax breaks are aimed at the rich. What\u2019s more, there are", "many differing views of what constitutes the \"rich.\" The point behind the", "loaded language is they don\u2019t help the average taxpayer.", "Ross highlighted three tax breaks:", "-- Health savings accounts: This legislation allows employees -- not", "employers -- to deduct contributions they make to their HSAs, which are", "used to pay medical expenses, from their state income taxes, as they can", "from their federal income taxes.", "Ross cited a May 2008 memo from the U.S. Government Accountability Office", "that says the average taxpayer who used an HSA in 2005 had an annual", "adjusted gross income of $139,000. He argues that that figure shows HSAs", "benefit \"the rich\" because the adjusted gross income of other tax filers", "was only $57,000.", "Berry doesn\u2019t buy that argument. He said large corporations and the rich", "\"are more likely to have employer-paid health insurance and would not need", "an HSA.\" He noted that nearly every other state allows the deduction,", "which conforms with federal tax law.", "-- Two capital gains changes: One change eliminates state capital-gains", "taxes on long-term investments in Wisconsin businesses; the other would", "defer taxes on capital gains reaped anywhere if the proceeds are plowed", "back into a Wisconsin business. Together, they would result in an", "estimated tax revenue reduction of $436 million over 10 years.", "Ross cited a fiscal bureau report on the two measures that said \"capital", "gain income is concentrated among high-income taxpayers.\"", "Berry said eliminating the long-term investment capital gains tax would", "tend to benefit people with higher incomes. The deferral measure, however,", "merely delays taxes and isn\u2019t a tax cut, he said.", "So, Part 3 of the claim is mixed.

Tax breaks \"cost\" Wisconsin taxpayers", "Ross argued that the tax breaks \"cost\" Wisconsin taxpayers \"because they", "are reducing the amount of revenue taken in by the state\" and because most", "taxpayers won\u2019t benefit from them.
