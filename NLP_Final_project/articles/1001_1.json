eligibility for Medicare from 65 to 67.", "Together, these changes would shift substantial costs to Medicare", "beneficiaries and (with the simultaneous repeal of health reform) leave", "many 65- and

voucher, that beneficiaries would use", "to purchase either private health insurance or a form of traditional", "Medicare.[1] \u00a0 Premium support would apply to all new beneficiaries", "starting in 2024 and to all other beneficiaries who chose to", "participate.[2]", "The value of the premium-support payment would initially equal the cost of", "the second-lowest-cost private health insurance plan in an area or", "traditional Medicare, whichever is less.\u00a0 As a result, the proposal\u2019s", "impact on individual beneficiaries would differ significantly, depending", "on whether traditional Medicare or private plans provided less costly", "coverage in their particular area of the country.\u00a0 In areas where Medicare", "incurs relatively high costs, the amount of the premium-support payment", "would equal the cost of a relatively inexpensive private plan, and", "beneficiaries would have to pay higher premiums to participate in", "traditional Medicare.\u00a0 In areas with relatively low Medicare spending,", "beneficiaries who wanted to enroll in a private plan would face higher", "premiums or fewer benefits, or might find that no private plan was", "available.", "The Ryan budget would limit the growth rate of Medicare spending for new", "beneficiaries from year to year, starting in 2024, to the growth rate of", "gross domestic product (GDP) per capita plus one-half percentage point \u2014", "an amount that will likely fall short of the actual growth of health care", "costs.[3] \u00a0 In its analysis of the similar premium support proposal in", "last year\u2019s Ryan budget, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected", "that federal Medicare expenditures on behalf of an average new beneficiary", "would be $400 to $700 (6 to 11 percent) less than under current law in the", "proposal\u2019s first year, $1,200 to $2,200 (14 to 23 percent) less in 2030,", "and $5,900 to $8,000 (35 to 42 percent) less in 2050.[4]", "Since under the Ryan budget, Medicare would no longer make payments to", "health care providers such as doctors and hospitals, the only way to keep", "Medicare cost growth within the target of GDP growth plus one-half", "percentage point would be to limit the annual increase in the amount of", "the premium-support vouchers.\u00a0 As a result, the vouchers would purchase", "less coverage with each passing

Medicare beneficiaries live on modest incomes and are not in a", "position to pay much more for their health care.\u00a0 The median income of", "Medicare beneficiaries is $25,000 a year (including

budgets on out-of-pocket health expenses as", "non-Medicare households do \u2014 15 percent compared to 5 percent.\u00a0 The Ryan", "budget would significantly raise the out-of-pocket health costs for", "Medicare beneficiaries with modest incomes, even as it proposes very large", "new tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.", "Premium support would likely impose particularly heavy burdens on", "low-income beneficiaries in poor health.\u00a0 Although the chairman is not", "specific, this year\u2019s proposal is apparently similar to his version from", "2011, in which people enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid under current", "law (the so-called \u201cdual eligibles\u201d) would receive all of their acute", "health-care benefits through Medicare \u2014 and would no longer be eligible", "for supplemental benefits not covered by Medicare or premium and", "cost-sharing assistance through Medicaid.[5] \u00a0Instead, the federal", "government would establish a medical savings account for each Medicare", "beneficiary with income up to the poverty line.\u00a0 The account would", "frequently prove inadequate to cover the additional costs that", "beneficiaries would face under premium support, however, and the proposal", "would substantially raise out-of-pocket costs for many dual eligibles.[6]", "Chairman Ryan claims that his proposal \u201censur[es] that traditional", "Medicare remains an option.\u201d\u00a0 Unfortunately, that\u2019s not the case.\u00a0\u00a0Under", "premium support, traditional Medicare would tend to attract a less healthy", "pool of enrollees, while private plans would attract healthier enrollees", "(as occurs today with Medicare and private Medicare Advantage plans).", "Although the proposal calls for \u201crisk adjusting\u201d payments to

differences in costs across plans that stem from", "differences in the health of enrollees.", "Inadequate risk adjustment would mean that traditional Medicare would be", "only partially compensated for its higher-cost enrollees, which would", "force it to raise premiums to make up the difference.\u00a0 The higher premiums", "would lead more of Medicare\u2019s healthier enrollees to abandon it for", "private plans, very possibly setting off a spiral of rising premium costs", "and falling enrollment for traditional Medicare.\u00a0 Over time, traditional", "Medicare would become less financially viable and could unravel \u2014 not", "because it was less efficient than the private plans, but because it was", "competing on an unlevel playing field in which private plans captured the", "healthier beneficiaries and incurred lower costs as a consequence.\u00a0 The", "Ryan plan also would allow private plans to tailor their benefit packages", "to attract healthier beneficiaries and deter sicker ones, which only makes", "this outcome more likely.", "Chairman Ryan says that his proposal would not affect people age 55 and", "older, but this claim, too, is unlikely to be true.\u00a0 As fewer new", "beneficiaries enrolled in traditional Medicare, the population in", "traditional Medicare would gradually get older, sicker, fewer in number,", "and much more expensive per person to cover. \u00a0Moreover, as the size of the", "Medicare population shrank, administrative costs would rise relative to", "benefit payments, traditional Medicare\u2019s power to demand lower payment", "rates from providers would erode, and providers would have less incentive", "to participate in the program.\u00a0 As a result, people now age 55 and older", "might well face higher premiums and cost sharing for traditional Medicare,", "a more limited choice of providers, or both.", "Raising the Age of Eligibility", "Starting in 2024, the Ryan budget would raise the eligibility age for", "Medicare \u2014 now 65 \u2014 by two months per year until it reaches age 67 in", "2035.\u00a0 At the same time, the plan would repeal health reform\u2019s coverage", "provisions.\u00a0 Consequently, 65- and 66-year-olds would have neither", "Medicare nor access to health insurance exchanges in which they could buy", "coverage at an affordable price and receive subsidies to help them secure", "coverage if their incomes are low.", "This change would drive 65- and 66-year-olds who don\u2019t have", "employer-sponsored coverage into a poorly regulated individual insurance", "market that charges older individuals extremely high premiums.\u00a0 People of", "limited means would be affected most harshly because they would not be", "able to afford private coverage.\u00a0 In addition, 65- and 66-year-olds with a", "pre-existing medical condition often would not be able to purchase", "coverage at any price.\u00a0 As a result, many 65- and 66-year-olds would find", "themselves without

and", "generic prescription drugs.\u00a0 These discounts and Medicare coverage will", "gradually increase until 2020, when the entire donut hole is closed.\u00a0 The", "Ryan budget would reopen the drug donut hole.", "Health reform also requires both private insurance companies and Medicare", "to cover preventive care services without any cost sharing.\u00a0 Preventive", "care includes screenings for chronic illnesses like diabetes and cancer", "and routine vaccines.\u00a0 The Ryan budget would reinstate cost sharing in", "Medicare for these preventive benefits.", "Limiting Malpractice Awards", "The Ryan budget would impose limits on medical malpractice litigation", "along the lines of H.R. 5, which the House passed on March 22, 2012.\u00a0 H.R.", "5 would have capped awards for punitive damages and required that a", "claimant initiate a claim within a year after he or she discovers or", "should have discovered an injury, whichever is earlier.", "CBO estimates that these changes would lower costs for Medicare and other", "health programs by reducing premiums for medical malpractice insurance and", "reducing the use of health care services (since medical providers, facing", "less pressure from malpractice suits, would order fewer unnecessary", "services).[8] \u00a0 Critics argue that these savings would come at the expense", "of those harmed by medical negligence, who would no longer be able to", "obtain full compensation for their injuries.[9]", "Raising Income-Related Premiums", "The Ryan budget would raise Medicare\u2019s income-related premiums.", "Currently, most Medicare beneficiaries pay premiums for Parts B and D", "(which cover physician services and prescription drugs, respectively) that", "represent about one-quarter of program costs.\u00a0 The standard Part B premium", "is $104.90 a month in 2013, but beneficiaries with incomes above $85,000", "(twice that amount for couples) must pay an extra amount that ranges from", "$42.00 to $230.80 a month.", "High-income beneficiaries also must pay more for their Medicare", "prescription drug benefit, with the same income thresholds as for the", "income-related Part B premium.\u00a0 The additional premium amounts for the", "drug benefit range from $11.60 to $66.60 a month.", "Under current law, the dollar thresholds for the income-related premiums", "are frozen through 2019 and adjusted annually for inflation after that.", "The Administration has proposed raising the income-related premiums by 15", "percent and freezing the income thresholds until 25 percent of Medicare", "beneficiaries are subject to the income-related premiums.\u00a0 The Ryan budget", "says its proposal in this area is similar to the Administration\u2019s but", "provides no further detail.", "Retaining the Sustainable Growth Rate Formula", "The Ryan budget establishes a \u201creserve fund\u201d that would allow Congress to", "repeal the cuts required by Medicare\u2019s sustainable growth rate (SGR)", "formula for physicians in a deficit-neutral manner.\u00a0 It does not, however,", "specify how policymakers would offset the ten-year, $138-billion cost.\u00a0 If", "Congress does not find a way to do so, the Ryan budget assumes that the", "SGR cuts will take effect.", "Enacted as part of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, the SGR formula", "determines how much Medicare pays for services that physicians", "provide.[10] \u00a0Under the SGR, cumulative Medicare spending on physicians\u2019", "services is supposed to follow a target path that depends on the rates of", "growth in physicians\u2019 costs, Medicare enrollment, and real GDP per person.", "If spending exceeds the SGR target for a year, then Medicare\u2019s payments", "to physicians for each service they provide are supposed to shrink in the", "following year to move total spending back toward the target path.", "Since 2003, Congress has regularly prevented the full cuts that the SGR", "required from taking effect, although it has not changed the underlying", "SGR formula or the cumulative spending targets, which remain in law.", "Because the SGR\u2019s designers underestimated the increase in the volume and", "complexity of doctors\u2019 services, the formula requires deep cuts in", "physician payments. \u00a0In 2014, the SGR calls for reducing physician", "payments rates by about 25 percent, though Congress is expected to prevent", "this cut from taking effect.\u00a0 The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission", "(MedPAC), Congress\u2019 expert advisory body on Medicare payment policy, finds", "that \u201cSuch reductions in physician payment rates, if they take place,", "would threaten beneficiaries\u2019 access to physician services.\u201d[11]", "Retaining Sequestration", "The Ryan budget retains the 2-percent \u201csequestration\u201d cuts in Medicare", "that the 2011 Budget Control Act (BCA) requires for 2013 through 2021 (it", "would repeal the sequestration cut in defense spending).\u00a0 The BCA", "established a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose", "legislation reducing deficits by $1.2 trillion over the 2012-2021 period", "and established a backup sequestration procedure. \u00a0Because the Joint", "Committee failed to achieve its goal, sequestration \u2014 a form of automatic", "cuts that apply largely across the board \u2014 takes effect in March and April", "2013 and is scheduled to run through 2021.", "The BCA limits the Medicare sequestration cut to 2 percent each year, to", "be achieved through cuts in payments to health care providers and private", "Medicare Advantage plans.\u00a0 This means that Medicare providers will", "continue to bill Medicare in the normal way, but Medicare will
