Introduction", "Squid and octopuses are abundant cephalopod molluscs that inhabit the", "marine environment from coastal areas to the abyss.

Benthic octopuses use their extensive", "repertoire of camouflage patterns to sneak up on or ambush prey [2].", "Cirrate octopods are believed to trap copepods by engulfment, using the", "web of thin tissue between their arms [3,4]. Squid have, in addition to", "their four arm pairs, a pair of highly extensible and contractile", "tentacles that allows them to grab prey in front of them [5]. Due to their", "speed and agility, some squid are able to catch fast-swimming prey like", "sardines and hake, while others are sit-and-wait predators who deploy", "their long tentacles to lure and ambush prey [6].", "The \u2018vampire squid\u2019 Vampyroteuthis infernalis, the sole species in the", "Order Vampyromorpha, is a phylogenetic relic with features of both", "octopods and squid [7]; they have eight arms but lack feeding tentacles.", "They do have two long, extensible, retractile filaments [7,8], which are", "presumably a modified arm-pair [9] and are thought to have a sensory", "function in the detection of food items and/or potential predators [4,10].", "The eight arms, which are joined by an extensive web, bear a longitudinal,", "distal row of up to 21 suckers and multiple finger-like projections called", "cirri [11].

Discussion", "Most modern cephalopods are predatory carnivores.

The", "food items that we found in digestive tracts, in droppings and", "regurgitations and that we saw being consumed during in situ observations", "were not representative of captured live prey. Instead, Vampyroteuthis'", "food consisted of agglomerated copepod parts, faecal pellets, diatoms,", "radiolarians and fish scales; often embedded in a mucus matrix. The most", "likely source of this eclectic mix is marine snow aggregates, including", "the feeding structures of larvaceans.", "Aggregated marine snow particles and \u2018sinkers\u2019 (discarded mucus filters of", "the giant larvacean Bathochordaeus) are very common within the depth range", "occupied by Vampyroteuthis in Monterey Bay [28,33]. When we observed", "Vampyroteuthis in situ with food in and around its mouth, the food clump", "typically appeared as an amorphous mass of small particles wrapped in", "mucus. Food material in the crops was similar, and was in some cases", "clearly identifiable as sinkers. The nutritional value of these large", "particles is surprisingly high, with an average organic carbon content of", "5.4 mg [28]. The sources of this carbon are the diatoms, crustaceans,", "faecal pellets and gelata that become trapped in the feeding filters while", "the larvaceans consume smaller suspended particles [34,35]. Various", "crustacean zooplankters feed on aggregates [35] and by feeding on", "aggregates, vampire squid also ingest the copepods, ostracods and", "amphipods that inhabit the aggregates, which may explain the source of", "complete crustaceans in the digestive systems. Utilization of marine", "aggregates is consistent with the low stable isotope signature measured in", "Vampyroteuthis' beaks [36], and also with the relatively weak musculature", "associated with Vampyroteuthis' beak and radula [10].", "At depth, individual Vampyroteuthis were frequently encountered motionless", "except for gentle fin undulations, with one of their retractile filaments", "extended. Occasionally, small particles or larger aggregates were visible", "on the filaments, on the arms or in the mouth. During laboratory feeding", "experiments, we repeatedly observed particle-laden filaments being drawn", "between the arms in a behaviour that removed the particles and deposited", "them near the mouth in a mucus matrix. Both lines of evidence strongly", "suggest that one of the functions of the retractile filament is food", "collection. The short, stiff hairs on the filament probably function to", "secure particles, while the abundant sensory cells may signal the presence", "of food to the brain. The food is transferred to the arms, wrapped in", "mucus secreted from glands in the non-grasping suckers, and the cirri move", "the resulting mass along the arms to the buccal area for ingestion. The", "large crop allows for relatively large volumes of dilute food to be taken", "in. The use of the filament in food collection allows not only the capture", "of larger aggregates, but also the capture of very small particles, which", "are wiped off by the arms and wrapped in mucus for transport to the mouth.", "Previous authors have suggested that the retractile filaments allow the", "detection of living prey and predators. In aquarium experiments, Hunt [4]", "presented live Artemia nauplii to Vampyroteuthis with extended filaments.", "When the nauplii contacted the filament, the vampire squid swam around the", "location where the nauplii touched the filament and enveloped them within", "its webbed arms. These observations suggest a tactile sensory function for", "the filaments that is in keeping with our histological results showing", "abundant sensory like cells, but seemingly contradicts our observations", "that vampire squid feed mostly on detrital matter. The filament, however,", "is likely a multi-functional organ that is deployed to detect and capture", "detrital matter but at the same time may detect the presence of predators", "and perhaps small living prey. Detected food items that are too big to", "attach to the filament may be captured by engulfment with the web.", "Although the feeding strategy of vampire squid is unlike any other", "cephalopod, aspects of it may be found in other related and unrelated", "organisms in the same environment. Meso- and bathypelagic cydippid", "ctenophores deploy long sticky filamentous tentacles for the acquisition", "of food [37] and coronate scyphozoans of the genus Atolla have a", "hypertrophied tentacle with a suggested role in feeding [38].", "Vampyroteuthis' feeding strategy resembles that of munnopsid isopods which", "share the deep water column of Monterey Canyon. Munnopsids collect marine", "snow particles and aggregates with hair-like projections on their", "extremely long legs and antenna, then remove the food by drawing the", "appendages through their mouth parts [39]. Like Vampyroteuthis, the", "pelagic, cirrate octopus Stauroteuthis has questionable grasping capacity", "in its suckers. They are known to have a photophore at the base of each", "sucker, perhaps to lure copepods into a mucus web in between the eight", "arms [40]. The mucus in Stauroteuthis is produced by the enlarged", "posterior salivary glands [3], which are reduced in Vampyroteuthis.", "A large percentage of marine snow particles, aggregates and sinkers are", "infused with bioluminescent organisms (e.g. radiolarians, small copepods,", "dinoflagellates, bacteria in faecal pellets) [41] and are capable of", "glowing during their descent to mesopelagic depths. So while Stauroteuthis", "may attract copepods with its own bioluminescence, vampire squid may", "benefit from the bacterial light that marine aggregates emit. First,", "Vampyroteuthis has large, highly developed eyes that are acutely sensitive", "to very dim light [42], and thus they can probably see the larger", "particles and aggregates as they transit the water column. Second, as many", "crustaceans are attracted to bioluminescent food sources [43], their", "presence enriches the aggregates on which they feed [35], thereby", "enriching the food of the vampire squid.", "Vampyroteuthis has the lowest metabolic rate recorded for any cephalopod,", "comparable to that of a scyphomedusa of the same size [26,44], but this", "characteristic alone is insufficient for survival in the OMZ [20].", "Permanent residents of the OMZ have a variety of respiratory and", "morphological adaptations [25]. For Vampyroteuthis, these include the", "typical respiratory protein, haemocyanin, but with a hightened affinity", "for oxygen [16]. Like many other cephalopods, vampire squid are virtually", "neutrally buoyant, which is valuable for a sedentary species in the OMZ", "because it reduces the physiological costs of locomotion. Reduced", "musculature and relatively limited locomotory capabilities are further", "adaptations that allow Vampyroteuthis to succeed in the OMZ. Seibel et al.", "[45] estimate that only short duration burst swimming is available or", "necessary for predator avoidance, because cryptic coloration and", "bioluminescent countermeasures [15] probably contribute more to survival.", "The primitive configuration of coleoid cephalopods is with 10 equal arms.", "Modern decapods with 10 unequal arms can be logically traced back to the", "earlier form. Octopods, with eight arms, have apparently lost one pair", "[46]. The broader filaments in hatchlings of Vampyroteuthis are more", "arm-like than in older individuals, which supports the interpretation that", "the filaments are the second pair of arms [47]. The central nerve of the", "filaments runs to the unusually large ventral magnocellular lobe, which is", "also found in Mastigoteuthis and Joubiniteuthis, squid with huge numbers", "of small suckers on their tentacles and/or arms. The size of their", "magnocellular lobes is probably related to the large amount of sensory", "information that is sent from the suckers to the brain in these squid.", "Although the function of this lobe is poorly known, it appears that the", "vampire squid's brain is receiving a great deal of information from the", "filaments (R. E. Young 2012, personal communication). We have shown that", "one of the functions of the filaments is food acquisition and handling,", "analogous to the arms and feeding tentacles of squid. Although the", "asymmetrical nature of the filaments, with muscle cells on the one side", "and sensory cells on the other, could be related to the coiling of the", "filament, the asymmetry corresponds with the morphology of arms and", "tentacles. Our findings of both function and form further support the", "hypothesis that the retractile filaments in Vampyroteuthis are actually", "modified arms.", "Based on extensive in situ observations over 20 years, laboratory studies", "of live specimens and analyses of preserved material, it appears that", "Vampyroteuthis off central and southern California and on both sides of", "the Baja California peninsula is primarily a detritivore, that takes", "advantage of the OMZ in these regions. Predation pressure is probably less", "than in the surrounding mesopelagic layers because of the respiratory", "constraints imposed by diminished oxygen levels [48]. A significant", "component of Vampyroteuthis' diet, large, nutrient-rich detrital", "aggregates, are very abundant within this depth range [28,33]. These", "factors allow the vampire squid to assume a relatively passive lifestyle,", "under a reduced selective pressure to invest in muscular tissue, resulting", "in extremely low metabolic rates. The combination of its unique", "locomotory, physiological and feeding adaptations allows Vampyroteuthis to", "permanently inhabit and be very successful in the centre of the OMZ, an", "otherwise hostile environment where predators are few and a particular", "type of food is abundant.", "Acknowledgements", "Richard E.
