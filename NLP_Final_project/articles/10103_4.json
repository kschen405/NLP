Nevertheless, G.O.P.", "presidential candidates have demonstrated a remarkable ability to strike a", "politically successful balance, quietly reassuring their conservative base", "of their anti-abortion commitment while publicly hewing to language that", "appeals to the pro-choice majority.", "While every Republican party platform since 1976 has called for a", "constitutional amendment to ban abortion in all cases, the men who have", "run on those platforms have been careful to use more measured language.", "George W.

Although McCain has a", "solid record of supporting abortion restrictions in the Senate, he has", "felt pressure to articulate that position \u0097 and prove his conservative", "bona fides \u0097 because of his strained relationship with religious", "conservatives.
